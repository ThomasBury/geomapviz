Installation
============

I recommend to install first cartopy. If you face a cartopy installation error, 
try to install first from pre-built binaries 

`conda install -c conda-forge cartopy`

For installing on Linux platform, some dependencies are required, 
see the cartopy documentation for details.

`pip install -U geomapviz`
